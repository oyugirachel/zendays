   <h1>RACHEL OYUGI</h1>
<hr>
   <p> "Rachel oyugi",is the christian and traditional fused name i was given on the wee hours of dawn on the 11th february! well the name commonly named after the birth of so many youngsouls is not just a 'name' but a much symbolic name referenced back to the early times BC(before the birth of christ), yeah an old ancient story of jacob who had a beautiful wife ,a persona with peculiar charecteristics,a queen in the making....thinking about it.. i think thats why so many centuries later the name is still being admired and adored to be best for the ideology that names often potray who a person is and who you become!its actually paradoxical that if you name your child 'chicken'your baby will behave like a chicken. so ironical!well lemme not drive away from the subject of the matter <i>'me'</i>well my full name (oyugi rachel okinyo okumu) is just but a prototype, a double clone to my fathers sister who died...so each and every time my family is like "you really resemble our sister even your characters",that to prove the theory of inheritance of character and looks from the power of a name!</p>


   <p>Well thinking of it! well it might be true based on the wide range of research from the world wide web,the largest virtual libararies,"Rachel's are leaders not followers you can help her out, follow her, or get out of the way, these lovely ladies take charge, they're fun, smart, artistic, loud, an just flat out the funniest people out there. Very protective of her friends and family, will be very kind to you, but watch out, they have mean streaks in them and can easily kick the shit out of someone if they want to. Sometimes they can be a bit sarcastic, but it's usually in humor or self defense. She probably won't give two flying shits if you say something about her, she'll probably punch you and walk away, but if you insult one of the many people she holds dear well... Lets just say, they'll never find your body. After doing something, weird, frightening or just random, they can say something nonchalantly and carry on normally. They're also quite good looking.
   Sometimes Rachel's can have a 'hero-complex' often shouting 'I AM THE HERO!!!' For know good reason, despite that statement which may come off as attention grabbing selfishness, Rachel's are actually very caring and often do good deeds without saying anything being a 'silent hero'

   She can and will take many hits in her life, like she's made of metal and is invincible, but she really does have a kind heart and is a huge softy" its actually funny that my celebrum actually believes in this ,that it has actually summarised my personality in simple words. what of the star sign? related with the date february11th? yeah the <b>'cold and intelligent' 'aquarius the queen' 'the water sign'</b> taking all the personalities test to know thyself vividly, am actually satistfied with the research...well in the 21 years of my existence in this earth has actually proved all those character annotations except one,<br>that am actually a poet! a mortal weird  being who finds satisfaction and meaning to life's meaningless things.</p>
